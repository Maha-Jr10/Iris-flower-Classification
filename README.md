# Iris Flower Classification Notebook

This project is a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to classify Iris flowers using various machine learning models. It includes all the stepsâ€”from data exploration and visualization to model training, evaluation, and making predictions on new data.

## Overview

The notebook covers the following:

- **Data Exploration:**  
  Loading the Iris dataset, visualizing feature relationships using pair plots, boxplots, violin plots, and count plots.
  
- **Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  Training multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM) with GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.
  
- **Model Evaluation:**  
  Evaluating models on a test set with confusion matrices, classification reports, and cross-validation.
  
- **Predictions on New Data:**  
  Making predictions on new flower measurements and visualizing the predicted probabilities.
  
- **Visualizations:**  
  Several plots are included to help interpret the data and model performance:
  - Count plots for species distribution.
  - Boxplots and violin plots for feature distributions by species.
  - Confusion matrix heatmaps.
  - Bar charts for prediction probabilities.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. **Open the Notebook:**  
   Open the `iris_flower.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   
2. **Run the Cells Sequentially:**  
   The notebook is organized into sections:
   - Data loading and exploratory analysis.
   - Model training and hyperparameter tuning.
   - Model evaluation and cross-validation.
   - Predictions on new data and visualization of prediction probabilities.
   
3. **Customize as Needed:**  
   Feel free to modify the cells to experiment with different models, parameter grids, or visualizations.

## Project Structure

Since all code is contained in a single Jupyter Notebook, the project structure is simple:

```
iris_flower.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook with the complete project code
README.md                    # This file
IRIS.csv                     # (Optional) Dataset file, if not loaded directly from a URL
```

## Conclusion

This notebook provides a step-by-step guide for Iris flower classification, making it a useful resource for learning about data exploration, model tuning, and evaluation techniques. It serves as both an educational resource and a practical template for building similar classification projects.
